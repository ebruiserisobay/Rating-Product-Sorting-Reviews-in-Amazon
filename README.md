# Rating Product &amp; Sorting Reviews in Amazon

## 1. Business Problem

One of the key challenges in e-commerce is the accurate calculation of post-purchase ratings for products. Solving this issue not only ensures greater customer satisfaction for e-commerce platforms but also boosts product visibility for sellers and provides a seamless shopping experience for buyers. 

Another significant problem is the accurate sorting of product reviews. As misleading reviews can directly impact product sales, they may result in both financial losses and customer churn. 

Addressing these two fundamental issues will not only increase sales for e-commerce platforms and sellers but also enable customers to complete their purchasing journey smoothly.
